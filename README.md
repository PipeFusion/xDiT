Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pivotal in text-to-image and text-to-video models, are driving advancements in high-quality image and video generation. 
With the escalating input sequence length in DiTs, the computational demand of the Attention mechanism grows **quadratically**! 
Consequently, multi-GPU and multi-machine deployments are essential to maintain real-time performance in online services.

To meet real-time demand for DiTs applications, parallel inference is a must.
xDiT is an inference engine designed for the parallel deployment of DiTs on large scale. 
xDiT provides a suite of efficient parallel inference approaches for Diffusion Models.

1. Sequence Parallelism, [USP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07719) is a unified sequence parallel approach combining DeepSpeed-Ulysses, Ring-Attention.

2. [PipeFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14430), a patch level pipeline parallelism using displaced patch by taking advantage of the diffusion model characteristics.

3. Data Parallel: Processes multiple prompts or generates multiple images from a single prompt in parallel across images.

4. CFG Parallel, also known as Split Batch: Activates when using classifier-free guidance (CFG) with a constant parallelism of 2.

The four parallel methods in xDiT can be configured in a hybrid manner, optimizing communication patterns to best suit the underlying network hardware.

xDiT offers a set of APIs to adapt DiT models in [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to hybrid parallel implementation through simple wrappers. 
If the model you require is not available in the model zoo, developing it yourself is straightforward; please refer to our [Dev Guide](#dev-guide).


We also have implemented the following parallel stategies for reference:

1. Tensor Parallelism
2. [DistriFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19481)

The communication and memory costs associated with the aforementioned parallelism in DiT are detailed in the table below. (* denotes that communication can be overlapped with computation.)


PipeFusion and Sequence Parallel achieve optimal performance on different scales and hardware configurations, making them suitable foundational components for a hybrid approach.

Leveraging multiple parallelism techniques togather is essential for efficiently scaling. 
It's important that the product of all parallel degrees matches the number of devices. 
For instance, you can combine CFG, PipeFusion, and sequence parallelism with the command below to generate an image of a cute dog through hybrid parallelism:


```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 \
examples/pixartalpha_example.py \
--model models/PixArt-XL-2-1024-MS \
--pipefusion_parallel_degree 2 \
--ulysses_degree 2 \
--num_inference_steps 20 \
--warmup_steps 0 \
--prompt "A small dog" \
--use_split_batch
```
In this command, the equation ulysses_degree * pipefusion_parallel_degree * cfg_degree(use_split_batch) == number of devices == 8 is satisfied, allowing the hybrid parallelism to function correctly.

‚ö†Ô∏è Applying PipeFusion requires setting `warmup_steps`, also required in DistriFusion, typically set to a small number compared with `num_inference_steps`.
The warmup step impacts the efficiency of PipeFusion as it cannot be executed in parallel, thus degrading to a serial execution. 
We observed that a warmup of 0 had no effect on the PixArt model.
Users can tune this value according to their specific tasks.

<h2 id="dev-guide">üöß  History and Looking for Contributions</h2>
We conducted a major upgrade of this project in August 2024.

The latest APIs is located in the [xfuser/](./xfuser/) directory, supports hybrid parallelism. It offers clearer and more structured code but currently supports fewer models.

The legacy APIs is in the [legacy/](./legacy/) directory, limited to single parallelism. It supports a richer of parallel methods, including PipeFusion, Sequence Parallel, DistriFusion, and Tensor Parallel. CFG Parallel can be hybrid with PipeFusion but not with other parallel methods.

For models not yet supported by the latest APIs, you can run the examples in the [legacy/scripts/](./legacy/scripts/) directory. If you wish to develop new features on a model or require hybrid parallelism, stay tuned for further project updates. 

We also welcome developers to join and contribute more features and models to the project. Tell us which model you need in xDiT in [discussions](https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT/discussions).
